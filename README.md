# Autonomous Dungeon Crawler AI

## Project Overview

This project involves developing an AI program that can autonomously play a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, inspired by [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon). The primary goal of the AI is to amass a high score by collecting as many coins as possible within the game environment. The AI employs the Expectimax search algorithm to navigate the dungeon, avoid obstacles, and prioritize coin collection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame (for game environment)
- Numpy (for mathematical computations)

1. Run the game environment with the AI:
    ```bash gameTesting.sh ```

2. The AI will start playing the game autonomously, making decisions to maximize the score by collecting coins.
